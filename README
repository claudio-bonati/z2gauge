********* PROGRAM FOR SIMULATION OF Z_2 MODELS *********
***************  WITH BROKEN SYMMETRY  *****************
********************************************************

** ACTION
*****************************************************

The partition function is written as Z=\sum e^{-S}, lambda_{x,mu}=+1,-1

S = - J \sum_{x, mu>0} lambda_{x,mu}
    - K \sum_{plaq} plaq

### add gamma

Macro:

DEBUG : several sanity checks are activated, which significantly slow-down the algorithm.
GAUGE_FIX
OPEN_BC : open boundary conditions

** CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The following macro is availbale

ST_dim      spacetime dimensionality (default 3)

After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make

Calling the executable without input file the configuration options are shown
and the template file "template_input.in" is produced.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling the executable without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.
